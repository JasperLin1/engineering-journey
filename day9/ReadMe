I learned 
When to use `await` and when not to use it?
How to design reusable asynchronous functions?
How to handle failures (retries/rollbacks)?
How to write asynchronous functions in real-world projects?

what's the letter a and b mean in ex1?
    a is promise, because asynchronous functions always return a Promise. And b is 42, because `await` will wait promise resolved and then to get value of resolved.
    The key point here is that When you call a asynchronous function, you will always get a Promise object. Unless you use `await` to wait for it.
what's x in ex2 ?
    x is promise that it's the same reasson with last question latter a.
why is it necessary to use .then()?
    the function of .then() that it's same with `await`.
what's v ?
    v is a value after promise resolved. So v equal "hello".
