let and const are hoisted, but they stay in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) and cannot be accessed until they are initialized.
var declarations are hoisted and initialized with undefined during the hoisting phase.
A closure allows an inner function to capture and retain access to variables from its outer scope, effectively creating private state.
