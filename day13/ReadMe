The key of object just only can store string and symbol, so it's not very convenient rether than using new Map. This can store number, object and function so on.
In this programming after counter Map, i used sortArary to sort the result, but Map is not like a array can be count. So i Convert the Map to an array and sort it by key (userId). And Switch back to map mode: This will preserve your sorting order.
