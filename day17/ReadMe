❗ Problems

If the same user calls the API 100 times per second, how to deal with?

User A: 100 hits per second

User B: Normal usage

If you block all attacks → terrible UX

If you accept all attacks → server crash

👉 Solution: Each user queues up individually

Rate limits are applied to a single user. If a queue is shared, a large number of requests from one user will block other users. Using a separate queue for each user can achieve traffic isolation and ensure that they do not affect each other.

1️⃣ What does this module do? 👉 This module manages and limits the number of concurrent asynchronous tasks per user. It uses a queuing system to control request execution order and concurrency levels.

2️⃣ What practical problem does it solve? 👉 It prevents individual users from overwhelming the system with too many requests, which ensures system resources remain available for everyone and maintains overall stability.

3️⃣ Why not just use a single shared queue? 👉 Using a single queue would allow one heavy user to bottleneck the entire system. By implementing per-user queues, we achieve traffic isolation, ensuring that one user’s high volume of requests doesn't affect the performance of others.
