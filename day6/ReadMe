What are the three states of a Promise?
    (Pending) This means that asynchronous operations (such as setTimeout) are still in progress and have not yet produced a result.
    (Fulfilled) This indicates that the operation has completed successfully. At this point, the `.then()` function will be triggered.
    (Rejected)  This indicates that an error has occurred or the operation has been blocked. In this case, the `.catch()` function will be triggered.
What do `resolve` and `reject` do?
    resolve(value): Its task is to change the state of a Promise from Pending to Fulfilled. It passes the result (e.g., "wait 1000 milliseconds") Pass it out to .then() for use.

    reject(error): Its task is to change the Promise's state from Pending to Rejected. It passes an error message or Error object to .catch() to notify the program that "something wrong".
Why return a new Promise?
    This is to allow the wait function to be "waited for".
What is await waiting for?
    Waiting for the "state change" of the Promise object. to decide return the value of resolve or rejected.
Why must it be wrapped in try/catch?
    Because await can not directly handle wrong message.
What does an async function return?
    async function always return a Promise object
